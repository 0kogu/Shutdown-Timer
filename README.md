# Shutdown Timer

## Overview

The **Shutdown Timer** is a simple Python application that allows users to schedule a shutdown of their computer. The program provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, where users can select the time in minutes or hours after which the computer should turn off.

## Features

- **Time Selection**: Users can choose the time before shutdown using a dropdown menu, with options ranging from 1 to 60 minutes or hours.
- **Cancel Shutdown**: An option to cancel the scheduled shutdown before the timer runs out.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with Tkinter for a simple and clean interface.

## How It Works

1. **Select Time**: Choose the amount of time (in minutes or hours) before the computer should shut down.
2. **Start Timer**: Click the "Start Timer" button to schedule the shutdown.
3. **Cancel Shutdown**: If needed, click the "Cancel Shutdown" button to abort the scheduled shutdown.
